Comments:

- From now on, all submissions are accepted only in PDF uploaded here in ILAIS. I highly suggest using the website:

https://upmath.me/

for your assignment. I made an introduction video for it, in the video section of the ILIAS page here.


- All calculation results should have units, correct numbers without units will not be considered

- For the programming exercises, if you are (still) using Windows you can download the excellent Python-distribution from:

https://winpython.github.io/

inside the package, there is "spyder" which you can easily use, as some of you already did.

- Please tidy up your GitHUB account in proper projects / folders! Some people's account looks like the office of one of my colleagues!!



Questions:


1- [1 point] Assuming that after a half-life, really half of the radioactive material disintegrates / decays, how many average half-lives does it approximately take, so that 14 grams of 14-C decays?

log0.5 (1/N_A) = 78.9

2- [1 point] Write *very short* definitions and classify the following concepts in groups:

Fermions
ganzzahliger Spinn
antisymmetrisch
Teilchen aus denen die Materie besteht
Obergruppe der Leptonen und Quarks

Bosons
n/2 Spinn, n=1,3,5,...
symmetrisch
Vermitteln kräfte

Hadrons
subatomare Teilchen, die von der starken Wechselwirkung zusammen gehalten werden
z.B. Neutronen, Protonen

Mesons
Untergruppe der Hadronen
Bosonen

Baryons
Untergruppe der Hadronen
Fermionen
Neutronen und Protonen Teil der Gruppe

Leptons
Fermionen
u.A. Elektron

Which elementary fermions can be accelerated in an accelerator?

Man braucht ein geladenes Teilchen, also:
Elektron


3- [1 point] A linear accelerator can accelerate protons to 1 GeV. What is the available CoM energy if we shoot the protons on a fixed Beryllium target for an industrial application? What would be the available CoM energy if we use two such accelerators to form a collider?



4- [1 point] Design an accelerator:

Write a python code, that calculates the lengths of the first 20 segments in a Wideröe structure for medical application, i.e. for Lithium-like 12-C ions. Choose a proper reference phase, acceleration voltage and RF frequency so that your accelerator fits in your bedroom!




[1 point extra!!!] If you use the decorator (numpy.vectorize) in the above code properly!


Please put the code on your GitHUB account and post the link to the repository here.
